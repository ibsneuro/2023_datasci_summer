# 2023 UniSA Summer Data Science course

This repository contains the website content for the 2023 data science summer wokshop at the Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Australian Research Centre for Interactive and Virtual Environments, University of South Australia. The course is designed to be an introduction to basics of data science using R, including data visualisation, transformation / wrangling, import and tidying. It also covers reproducibility using RMarkdown and tips for a reproducible workflow.

Given the brevity of the workshop (3 days) and that it does not presuppose any prior knowledge, it is intended as a foundation on which future, self-directed learning can build. Statistical modelling is beyond the scope of the course.
