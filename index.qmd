title: "Introduction to Data Science with R"
---

This 3-day workshop will allow students to develop critical skills in analysing and drawing inferences from data using contemporary open-source computational tools. It will further introduce students to principles of open and reproducible science and thereby the ethical handling of data.

These skills are crucial for quantitative research across a wide range of disciplines. They are also highly transferable across different domains and types of data, thus offering students a foundation for lifelong learning and problem solving, as well as potential applications in a range of different professions.
