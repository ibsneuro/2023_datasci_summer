## Quarto basics

You already have quite a bit of experience with creating basic R Quarto documents. You will want to create a more appealing document. Here are a few more tips to help you get started with this. For a comprehensive guide, see <https://quarto.org/docs/guide/>.

### Additional Markdown formatting

You can embed additional levels of subheadings by using more hashes. To make text appear **bold** or in *italics* use asterisks. For embedded code, use backticks, e.g. to refer to a function such as `filter()`. 

There are many more options, e.g. allowing you to embed tables. See the [Markdown basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) section of the Quarto documentation for further details.[^1]

[^1]: Note how this paragraph also shows you how to include a link to a website -- and this footnote!

### Dotpoints and lists

* dotpoints can be created easily
* by using asterisks (hyphens work ntoo)
* to create different levels
  * use tabs
  * here is one more

1. numbered lists
2. work in much the same way

## Customising overall appearance

To customise the overall appearance of your Quarto document, you can change the theme.
This document use the *zephyr* theme, with a title block banner.
See the [html theming section](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) of the Quarto documentation for further details.

There are also many other options, e.g. in regard to including a table of contents (or not) and how it is displayed.
We have been working with html output and will continue to do so.
However, you can also produce other output formats like pdf (again, see the documentation for details).

If you want to share your document with others, you will usually want to set the self-contained option to true (see line 12 of the header).

## Customising code chunks

You may or may not want code to appear in your output.
You can customise the behaviour of individual code chunks by setting the appropriate option at the beginning of the chunk using the `#|` syntax.
For example, the chunk below runs code to create a penguins plot but does not display the code itself in the knitted document.
This is accomplished by adding `echo: false` as a parameter.
If you want to set `echo: false` for all chunks, you can do this by replacing the `echo: true`in line 13 of the header.
As you can see, the header also sets `warning: false` and `message: false` for the entire document, so that warnings and messages (e.g. the one that you normally see when you load the tidyverse) aren't included in the output. 

```{r}
#| echo: false

penguins  |>  
  filter(!is.na(sex))  |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4, size = 2) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 5) +
  scale_colour_npg() +
  theme_cowplot() +
  guides(colour = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Of the Palmer peninsula penguins, \nGentoo penguins have the longest flippers",
    subtitle = "larger dots indicate by-species means",
    x = "",
    y = "Flipper length (mm)",
    caption = "source: Gorman et al. (2014) via the palmerpenguins R package"
  )

```

## Including other images

Including other image files is easy! Note that you need to provide the location of the image file relative to your Rmd document (this is called a "path" in technical terms). The syntax to insert the image below assumes that there is a file called "palmerpenguins.png" that is located in a subfolder called "images" of the folder in which the Rmd is located. (The idea here is similar to reading in csv or other files for data exploration and analysis.)
